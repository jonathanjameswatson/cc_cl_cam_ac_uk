(* We are going to use some of the basic
   transformation described in this directory to
   derive the Fibonacci Machine!

   First read these files

       cps.ml   : continuation-passing-style (cps)
       dfc.ml   : defunctionalization (dfc)
       tail.ml  : tail calls, replace recursion with iteration

   We will eliminate recursion from fib by
   1) transform fib with cps
   2) dfc results
   3) see that resulting continuations represent lists (stacks really)
   4) rewrite code using lists (stacks really)

   The result in Fibonacci Machine computes using iteration,
   step-by-step, and so Ocaml should compile this into code
   that is iterative (not using Ocaml's runtime stack).
   However, the Fibonacci Machine carries its own stack!

   The easiest way to use this file is to enter the Ocaml read-eval print loop
   and type
       #use "fibonacci_machine.ml";;

   We are really defining a
   state-transition system  with two distinct state types

(* Finally, The Fibonacci Machine!

   Since eval is now tail-recursive, I'll rewrite it to
   make this very explicit (as a step function and an eval function).

   I'll add some pretty-printing at this point so that
   we can watch our machine grind out Fibonacci numbers.
